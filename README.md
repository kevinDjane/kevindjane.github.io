# [Project 1: Movie Recommendation System Model]{https://github.com/kevinDjane/Movielens_KevinJane}

This capstone project is the #1 out of 2 projects for the [final course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-capstone?delta=3) of a nine-course series of the [Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science).

The database used in this project, was introduced in for some exercises in the course [PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-machine-learning?delta=0). 

This [MovieLens project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872), was inspired by the Netflix Kaggle competition, that created an algorithm with a error rate by at least 10%. The algorithm created an improved movie recomendation system.
With the 10M dataset, our goal is to accomplish a similar algorithm with R, to create a recommendation system for the provided users that would recommend movies based on rating. The course goal is to acomplish a RMSE lower than **0.86490**. I achieved an RMSE of **0.8648170**.
