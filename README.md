**Software:** Excel

This research was based on the work developed by the Harvard Public Opinion Project (HPOP), where, in this edition, issues related to electoral participation, political tendencies, trust in institutions, tolerance and perception about axes that, according to young people, should be considered as strategic for the country's development were taken into account. The second edition of the IDEJ was promoted by the ID as part of the program 
the ID, within the framework of the Rule of Law and Culture of Integrity program, with technical and financial support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

I was part of the Data Analysis team, that developed the analysis of the Aldrich-McKelvey model, it was established that the preferences of the young people surveyed are located in the following areas of the young people surveyed are located in the center with a slight bias to the left. 
This is related to the fact that young people were mostly in favor of state intervention, with the exception of national intervention. 
intervention, with the exception of the nationalization of the country's most important companies. Precisely, the model aligned this issue with the right-wing ideology, more associated with liberalism. 
On the other hand, the density curve reflects that young people are mostly concentrated in the center ideology (0), being this the point of origin from which their respective preferences are delineated. However, the Aldrich-McKelvey model does not identify all the dimensions that make up the political spectrum. 

## [Fairwork Iniciative (The case of Paraguay). November, 2022](https://www.tedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fairwork-Paraguay-Report-2022-ES.pdf)

**Software:** Excel

Fairwork is an international action-research project that assesses working conditions in the platform economy in more than 30 countries. Digital labor platforms are assessed against five fair labor principles: Fair Pay, Fair Conditions, Fair Contracts, Fair Management and Fair Representation.

During this project, I was part of the team that analyzed all the interviews of workers and representatives of the companies involved. The data were systematized and translated into English for better understanding.

For this report, we have assessed six platforms for and delivery services in Paraguay: Bolt, Uber, Uber Paraguay: Bolt, Uber, inDriver, MUV, PedidosYa and Monchis. 
The overall scores were very low and show that there is still a lot of work to be done to that much remains to be done to ensure basic labor standards for basic labor standards for platform workers in Paraguay. platform workers in Paraguay. Of the six platforms only two, MUV and PedidosYa, were able to score points. points. These two platforms lead the first Fairwork ranking in ranking in Paraguay with a score of two and one point respectively. and one point respectively. In view of these results, the platforms should take platforms must take concrete measures to ensure that their workers that their workers have basic labor rights.

**Programming Lenguage:** R

This capstone project is the #1 out of 2 projects for the [final course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-capstone?delta=3) of a nine-course series of the [Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science).

The database used in this project, was introduced in for some exercises in the course [PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-machine-learning?delta=0). 

This [MovieLens project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872), was inspired by the Netflix Kaggle competition, that created an algorithm with a error rate by at least 10%. The algorithm created an improved movie recomendation system.
With the 10M dataset, our goal is to accomplish a similar algorithm with R, to create a recommendation system for the provided users that would recommend movies based on rating. The course goal is to acomplish a RMSE lower than **0.86490**. I achieved an RMSE of **0.8648170**.

**Programming Lenguage:** R

This capstone project is the #2 out of 2 projects for the [final course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-capstone?delta=3) of a nine-course series of the [Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science).

The database used in this project, was done by Barry Becker from the [1994 Census database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income). 
With this dataset, our goal is to use at least two more complicated models that we used in the first project, that was a Movie Recommender from the [MovieLens Project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872), in that case we used only one metric for the models, that was the REMSE (Root Mean Square Deviation).
For this project, we try to predict the **Income Level** with three models (SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) and four metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity and Specificity) to evaluate our models.

## [Analysis of the determinants of scientific productivity of researchers in Paraguay and it's potential impact on higher education in Paraguay. November, 2021](https://desarrollo.edu.py/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DIGITAL-Informe-final-PINV18-1532-1.pdf)

**Software:** Excel

The objective of this research is to analyze econometrically through the H index the determinants of scientific productivity of researchers in Paraguay and its potential effect on higher education in Paraguay.

I was part of the team that built the database of researchers who were part of the researcher program (PRONII), as well as those who were not.
From this, I performed the analysis of the data to generate a storytelling that fits the needs of the research.
The aforementioned H-index was created based on public data available in Google Scholar.

The most interesting results were:
- The productivity of women, as measured by the h-index, is 14% lower than that of a male researcher with all other characteristics equal.
- The factors that make the academic training process, all other variables equal, a researcher with a Phd is expected to have an h-index between 69% and 85% higher than that of a researcher with only a bachelor's degree.
- In summary, when considering spaces for actions aimed at promoting greater productivity of researchers in Paraguay, the importance of training at the doctoral level stands out, and that it should be in the best ranked universities.

## [Determining factors in the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). July, 2021](https://oei.int/oficinas/paraguay/publicaciones/factores-determinantes-del-aprovechamiento-de-las-tecnologias-de-la-informacion-y-la-comunicacion-tic-en-la-ensenanza-y-aprendizaje-de-estudiantes-de-la-educacion-escolar-basica-y-educacion-media-de-instituciones-oficiales-de-paraguay)

**Software:** Excel

The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze the determinants of the use of ICTs by students, teachers, principals and parents/guardians of elementary and middle school education in officially managed educational institutions, whose results will serve as a baseline for designing policies and implementing educational programs and projects that incorporate the use of ICTs in educational centers and at home, as a support tool in the teaching and learning process.

I was part of the research team that performed the analysis of the data that was previously collected and processed.

Among the results found, the most outstanding are:
- Very few students have laptops at home, only 8.0% of students in the 1st and 2nd cycles of basic school education and 15.7% of those in the 3rd cycle of basic and middle school education, and even fewer have desktop computers.
- Only 1 out of every 4 BSE and MS students has wired or wireless Internet access.
- The gap in the use of WhatsApp by area (urban vs. rural) is almost 40 percentage points between students in the 1st and 2nd cycle of basic school education; this gap is smaller between students in the 3rd cycle of basic school education and middle school education (11.6 percentage points).
