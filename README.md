**Programming Lenguage:** R

This capstone project is the #1 out of 2 projects for the [final course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-capstone?delta=3) of a nine-course series of the [Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science).

The database used in this project, was introduced in for some exercises in the course [PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-machine-learning?delta=0). 

This [MovieLens project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872), was inspired by the Netflix Kaggle competition, that created an algorithm with a error rate by at least 10%. The algorithm created an improved movie recomendation system.
With the 10M dataset, our goal is to accomplish a similar algorithm with R, to create a recommendation system for the provided users that would recommend movies based on rating. The course goal is to acomplish a RMSE lower than **0.86490**. I achieved an RMSE of **0.8648170**.

**Programming Lenguage:** R

This capstone project is the #2 out of 2 projects for the [final course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-capstone?delta=3) of a nine-course series of the [Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science).

The database used in this project, was done by Barry Becker from the [1994 Census database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income). 
With this dataset, our goal is to use at least two more complicated models that we used in the first project, that was a Movie Recommender from the [MovieLens Project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872), in that case we used only one metric for the models, that was the REMSE (Root Mean Square Deviation).
For this project, we try to predict the **Income Level** with three models (SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) and four metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity and Specificity) to evaluate our models.
